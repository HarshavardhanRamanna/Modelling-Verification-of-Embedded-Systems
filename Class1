Embedded Systems are systems which have to compute. But the computation itself not the end result.
They have to be reactive and needs to be integral woth physical systems.
They also tend to work as part of a network.

Models are abstractions of real systems. They need to be simple enough to reson but detailed enough to capture properties of interest.
Abstraction layers need to hide non-essential information from the lower layers.
The flow is usually Model -> Design -> Analysis

The abstraction levels are qi=uite apparent un intergrated circuits. The various layers in an intergrated circuit are homogenous in nature, allowing easy
abstractions. This is not the case with embedded systems. This is accentuated also by the fact that embedded systems are usually time-reliant.
