Signals are functions. Functions are mappings from domain to co-domain. It is represented by F: R -> R or R^R. Codomain ^ Domain.

If we consider f to be defining a
subset (1,3,5) of A, then what does F
represent (with regard to subsets)?

Ans: F is the powerset i.e, set of all combination sets.

Pure signals are those that only take values Present and Absent.
Impure signals take values Absent along with values = Absent U {values}

Reactions are updates and are triggered when at least one of the input signals is not Absent.

Deterministic FSMs are those that have Inputs, Outputs, States, Initial States and Updates all defined.
